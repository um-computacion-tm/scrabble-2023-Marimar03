Scrabble a board-and-tile game in which two to four players compete forming words with lettered tiles on a 225-square board; words spelled out by letters on the tiles interlock like words in a crossword puzzle. There are 100 letter tiles, each imprinted with a point value for different letters.
The player who has scored the greatest number of points is the winner
